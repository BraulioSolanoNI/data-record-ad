Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are a rapidly advancing area of investment for automotive companies. These systems range from basic cruise control all the way to full self-driving of vehicles. These features are designed to reduce the fatalities from driver-error, as well as to decrease the effort to control a vehicle safely.

The NI Data Record System AD is an Application System designed to help engineers collect high-fidelity data from ADAS data sources (Cameras, Lidar, Radar, automotive buses, etc.) and log them to in-vehicle data storage. This data is used to train perception algorithms, as well as augmentation to software simulation data. This system will consist of a PXIe- chassis full of instrumentation to collect the data, a RAID storage device to store the data, and potentially other system completion pieces as needed. This system is sold by NI, and includes Data Record AD - a plug-in-based data logging software. This repository is for plug-ins, documentation, and tooling to extend the Data Record AD software's functionality.  

## Plug-in Collection
The plug-ins found here are open-source. Some will be NI supported, others will be completely community driven. Please see the plug-in documentation within each plug-in's folder to get details on the plug-in description, functionality, and to-dos for users. 

## Plug-in Developer's Guide
NI also provides guidance for Data Record AD Plug-in development to ensure performant plugins that work well with other Data Record AD plug-ins.
